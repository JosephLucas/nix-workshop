# Scrive Nix Workshop

Welcome to Scrive Nix Workshop! This book contains the workshop materials
used for training Haskell developers at [Scrive](https://www.scrive.com/).
(We are [hiring Haskell developers](https://careers.scrive.com/jobs/996814-haskell-developer)!)

We are open sourcing this content so that the Nix community can also benefit
from the content and make contribution to improve it.

The content in this workshop is currently organized based on the workshop sessions
we have held at Scrive. With the materials open sourced, we welcome to changes
to make this more catered for the general audience in the Nix community.
We hope that the current materials are still useful for more people to learn
about Nix.

Nix is a rather difficult subject with a steep learning curve, even for us!
So this is also our chance to learn from the rest of the Nix community.
If there is any mistake or misconception in this book, do let us know!
